You are a semantic segmentation expert. Identify all natural topic boundaries in this section:

Text:
---
[SECTION TEXT - 2000-4000 tokens]
---

For each boundary, provide:
- Line number where boundary occurs
- Reason: Why does the topic change here?
- Coherence before boundary (on scale 1-10, is content before boundary cohesive?)
- Coherence after boundary (does new section start cleanly?)

Output: JSON array of boundaries with reasoning.
