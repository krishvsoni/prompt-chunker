- Never compare parsers and semantic chunkers using size-based optimality.

- Relevance % alone is meaningless without Top-K Sufficiency.

- If Semantic Accept % < 40%, force refinement before reporting.

- Always report K used in retrieval metrics.

- Never average metrics across documents of different tiers without labeling.
